**Smart Traffic Simulation and Recognition using MNIST**
=====================================================

### Project Overview

This project aims to develop a smart traffic simulation and recognition system using the MNIST dataset to reduce accidents on the road. The system utilizes two machine learning algorithms, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to recognize and classify traffic patterns. By comparing the performance of these two algorithms, we can determine the most effective approach for reducing accidents.

### Motivation

Traffic accidents are a major concern worldwide, resulting in thousands of fatalities and injuries every year. One of the primary causes of accidents is human error, which can be mitigated by implementing intelligent transportation systems that can detect and respond to traffic patterns in real-time. This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to recognize traffic patterns and reduce accidents.

### Dataset

The MNIST dataset, consisting of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, is used to simulate traffic patterns. Each image is resized to represent a traffic scenario, with different digits corresponding to different traffic conditions (e.g., 0-9 representing different traffic densities).
